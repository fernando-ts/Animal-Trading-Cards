			<!-- Overall info about my fav. animal -->
			<p>Lions are big-time predators. They go after wildebeests, wild hogs, zebras, antelopes, hares, birds, amphibians, impalas, fish, gazelles, giraffes, ostrich eggs, reptiles, rodents, and buffalo. These felines seek out mammals that are between small and moderate size. Lions also are in no way choosy. If a lion can catch an animal, she'll most likely eat it. Female lions do not have manes, so they stand out far less than males, and they do most of the hunting. Although lions are ferocious, strong and large, they do have some predators of their own. These include human beings and hyenas.</p>
